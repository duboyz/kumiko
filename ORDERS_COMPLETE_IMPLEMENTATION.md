## 🔧 Important Implementation Details

### TimeSpan Serialization Fix
The backend uses `TimeSpan` for pickup time, but JSON doesn't serialize it well. Solution:
- Backend accepts `pickupTime` as **string** in format `HH:mm:ss`
- Backend returns `pickupTime` as **string**
- Frontend sends time from `<input type="time">` and appends `:00` for seconds
- This ensures clean JSON serialization

### Request Format
The CreateOrder endpoint uses a **separate request DTO** (`CreateOrderRequest`) that accepts a string for `pickupTime`, then converts it to `TimeSpan` internally.

## 🎊 You're All Set!
