## General Rules
- Use pnpm
- Use Shadcn
- Make the solutions short and concise
- Suggest making a new type or ask for file path if unsure instead of using :any or as any
- Never duplicate code.

## Backend Architecture (Vertical Slice)
- Each endpoint gets its own folder in Features/
- Each folder contains: Controller, Handler, and Command/Query
- Follow vertical slice architecture pattern

## Frontend Architecture
### API Implementation Pattern
When implementing backend endpoints:
1. Create types for response (and command/request) in `web/shared/types/`
2. Create the API function in `web/shared/api/`
3. Create a hook using TanStack Query in `web/shared/hooks/`

### Component Organization
- All components go into `stories/`
- Each component gets a corresponding story file
- Follow Storybook component structure
